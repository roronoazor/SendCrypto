                <p>
                  Initial dex offerings, or IDOs, are tokens that represent any
                  type of asset hosted on a decentralized exchange (DEX) â€” an
                  IDO is when a project launches a token through a decentralized
                  liquidity exchange. IDOs can be created for anything from
                  cryptocurrency to a music album, to aether powered battle
                  ships. IDOs offer businesses a tool for engaging their
                  communities in an economy that both enriches their products
                  and services while allowing them to make smart business
                  decisions regarding their assets.

                  offerings receive financing from individual investors. Unlike
                  an initial public offering, investors in initial dex offerings
                  never own any equity in the project. IDOs have some benefits
                  that may make them more attractive than

                  is based on the use of tokens, which can be bought, sold, or
                  traded. Ethereum was launched in 2015, and since then it has
                  become one of the driving forces behind the popularity of
                  cryptocurrency. In the Ethereum system, tokens represent a
                  diverse range of digital assets, such as vouchers, IOUs, or
                  even real-world, tangible objects. Essentially, Ethereum
                  tokens are smart contracts that make use of the Ethereum
                  blockchain.
                </p>

                <h3>What Is ERC-20?</h3>

                <p>
                  One of the most significant Ethereum tokens is known as
                  ERC-20. ERC-20 has emerged as the technical standard; it is
                  used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for
                  token implementation and provides a list of rules that all
                  Ethereum-based tokens must follow.
                </p>

                <p>
                  ERC-20 is similar, in some respects, to bitcoin, Litecoin, and
                  any other cryptocurrency; ERC-20 tokens are blockchain-based
                  assets that have value and can be sent and received. The
                  primary difference is that instead of running on their own
                  blockchain, ERC-20 tokens are issued on the Ethereum network.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Plenty of well-known digital currencies use the ERC-20
                  standard, including Maker (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT),
                  Augur (REP), and OmiseGO (OMG).
