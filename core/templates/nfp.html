                  The NFP report: The most important economic indicator for the
                  US
                </h3>

                <p>Definition :</p>

                <p>
                  NonFarm Payrolls report measures the number of jobs added or
                  lost in the US economy over the last month. It is released
                  usually on the first Friday of each month, at 8:30 EST. It is
                  published by the
                  <a
                    href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"

                <p>
                  This report is important because the US is the largest economy
                  in the world and its currency (US Dollar) is the global
                  reserve currency. The many economies peg (tie) their
                  currency's value to the reserve currency, many commodities
                  such as gold and oil are priced in terms of the reserve
                  currency and the local economy's debt is priced in terms of
                  its own currency.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The NFP report, because of its importance to the reserve
                  currency, tends to move all markets: currencies, equities,
                  treasuries, interest rates and also commodities. It does it so
                  immediately after the release of the economic data and
                  sometimes so dramatically.

                  CoinTrack Advisors Team while trading NFP releases base their
                  advice on a previous preparation and some fundamental
                  research. The elaboration of some macroeconomical analysis is
                  essential for successful trading.

                <h3>The NFP Trading Strategy</h3>

                <p>
                  The NFP report generally affects all major currency pairs, but
                  one of the favorites among our traders is the
                  <a
                    href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/g/gbp-usd-british-pound-us-dollar-currency-pair.asp"

                  >
                  Because the forex market is open 24 hours a day, all traders
                  have the ability to trade the news event.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Our logic behind the strategy is to wait for the market to
                  digest the information's significance. After the initial
                  swings have occurred, and after market participants have had a
                  bit of time to reflect on what the number means, we will enter
                  a trade in the direction of the dominating

                  >
                  We wait for a signal indicating the market may have chosen a
                  direction to take rates. This avoids getting in too early and
                  decreases the probability of being
